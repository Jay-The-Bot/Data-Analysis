Filtering pandas dataframe

We can do it through, 
is_huge = brics["area"] > 8
brics[is_huge]

This will give us a all the rows from the brics dataframe which are bigger than
8 in area

This can also be done as a one liner
brics[brics["area"] > 8]

We can also use the logical_and, logical_or, and the other functions of the numpy libraries.
By importing np
np.logical_and(brics["area"] > 8, bricks["area"] < 10)

To show the data we can use

bricks[np.logical_and(brics["area"] > 8, bricks["area"] < 10)]
