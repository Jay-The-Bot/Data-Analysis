Dictionaries
Dictionaries help in connecting 2 sepreate arrays without the help of their 
indexs.

Dictionaries are implemented within culy bracket {}
	{
		"key":value,
		"key1":value1, ...
	}

world = {
		"afganistan":30.55,
		"albania":2.77,
		"algeria":39.21
	}

To print somekey from dictionary, 
we use print('albania' in world)

to find population of albania we type world["albania"]
You pass the key in the square brackets and you get the corresponding value.

We can print out all the keys through print(world.keys()) method.

All the keys in the dictionaery should be unique.
Keys have to be immutable objects(Can not be changed after they are created).
Only list is muttable in python

To add data to the world dictioanry we can,
world["sealand"]=0.00027
This will add the sealand to the world dictionary.
We can also check by, "sealand" in world -> true.

With the same syntax we can also change the value.
To remove the sealand from the world dictionary
del(world["sealand"])

THe list is a sequence of number that are indexed by a range of numbers.
A dictinary is indexed by unique key, that can be any immutable type.

If you have a collection of values where the order matters, and you want to 
easily get entire subset of data, you'll want to go with a list.

If you need some kind of a lookup table, where looking for data should be fast
and where you can specify unique keys, a dictionary is a preffered option.
