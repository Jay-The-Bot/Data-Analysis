Merging a table with itself ->

This is also known as self join we do this to change the order of the data
in the table.

original_sequels = sequels.merge(sequels, left_on='sequel', right_on='id', suffixes=['_org', '_seq'])

print(original_sequels[,['title_org', 'title_seq']].head()) -> This will only print
the title_org and the title_seq table from the original_sequels.

When to merge a table with itself ->
1. Hierarchical relationships (Employee, Manager)
2. Sequential relationships (Logistics movement)
3. Graph data (Network of friends)
