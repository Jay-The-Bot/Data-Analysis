A left join return all rows of data from the left table and
only those rows from the right table where the key columns match.

To merge 2 df using left join we use ->
movies_tagline = movies.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

The default value of how is inner.

Whenever there isn't a matching ID in the matching table, a null value is entered 
for the tag line. 

NaN == Null

A left join will return all of the rows from the left table. If those rows in the left table
match multiple rows in the right table, then all of those rows will be returned. 
Therefore, the returned rows must be equal to if not greater than the left table. 
Knowing what to expect is useful in troubleshooting any suspicious merges.
