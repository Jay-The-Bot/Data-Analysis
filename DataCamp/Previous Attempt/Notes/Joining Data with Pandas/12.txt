merge_asof() ->
Another method for ordered or time-series data
The merge_asof() method is similar to a ordered left join.

Unlike an ordered left join, merge_asof() will match on the nearest value columns rather than equal values, 
it also follows the less than or equal to rule.
Whatever columns you merge it must all be sorted.

pd.merge_asof(visa, ibm, on='date_time', suffixes=('_visa', '_ibm'))

pd.merge_asof(visa, ibm, on='date_time', suffixes=('_visa', '_ibm'), direction='forward') ->
This will change the behavior of the method to select the first row in the right table whose
'on' key is greater than equal to left key's left column.
The default value for direction argument is 'backward'.
'nearest' -> where the rows with the nearest times are matched.

When to use merge_asof() ->
1. Data sampled from a process
2. Developing a training set no data leakage.
