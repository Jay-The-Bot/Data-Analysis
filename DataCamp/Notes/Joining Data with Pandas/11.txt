Using .merge_ordered() ->
This method can merge time-series and other ordered data.

The result is similar to the standard merge method in outer join, 
but here the results are sorted.
The sorted result makes it useful method for ordered or time-series data.

Difference between .merge() and .merge_ordered()
1. Both have same columns to join on -> [on, left_on, right_on]
2. Both have 4 types of join [left, right, inner, outer], for merge the .default() is inner,
and for the .merge_ordered() the default is outer.
3. Both the methods support suffixes.
4. Calling method -> df1.merge(df2), pd.merge_ordered(df1, df2)

For .merge_ordered() we can fill in the missing values with the previous value.
It is known as Forward fill, to do this we set the  fill_method='ffill'
ffill -> Forward fill

pd.merge_ordered(appl, mcd, on='date', suffixes=('_aapl', '_mcd'), fill_method='ffill')

When to use merge_ordered() ->
1. When you are working with order or time-series data.
2. Filling missing value(Most ML algo require that there are no missing values) 

.corr() -> gives correlation
subset columns -> gdp_sp500[['gdp', 'returns']]
