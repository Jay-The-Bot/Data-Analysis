Reshaping data with .melt() ->
This method will unpivot a table from wide to long format.
This is often a much more computer friendly format

Sometimes we come across data where every row relates to one subject,
and each column has different information about the an attribute of that subject.
Data formatted in this way is often called wide.

There are other times when the information about one subject is found over many rows,
and each row has one attribute about that subject. Data formatted in this way is often
called long or tall.

In general, wide formatted data is easier to read by people than long formatted.
However, long formatted is more accessible for the computer to work with.

social_fin_tall = social_fin.melt(id_vars=['financial', 'company'])
id_vars -> These are columns to be used as identifier variables.

social_fin_tall = social_fin.melt(id_vars=['financial', 'company'], value_vars=['2018', '2017'])
value_vars -> This argument will allow us to control arguments which are unpivoted.
Here we unpivot only 2018 and 2017 columns, so our output only has 2018 and 2017 columns.

social_fin_tall = social_fin.melt(id_vars=['financial', 'company'], value_vars=['2018', '2017'], var_name=['year'], value_name='dollars')
var_name and value_name helps us to rename the columns.
