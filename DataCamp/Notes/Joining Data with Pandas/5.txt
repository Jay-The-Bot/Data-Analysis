Other joins ->

Right join ->

It will return all the rows from the right table and only includes those from the 
left table that have matching values.

It is the mirror opposite of the left join.

tv_movies = movies.merge(tv_genre, how='right', left_on='id', right_on='movie_id')

The left_on and right_on allows ud to tell the merge key columns from each table
to merge the tables.

Outer join ->

An outer join will return all the rows from both the tables regardless there
is a match between tables.

action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull() -> selects all the columns which contain
the null value.
