Pandas is a module for working with tabular data, or data that has rows and columns
E.g:- Spreadsheet and Database tables

Pandas Features:- 
1. Load tabular data from multiple sources
2. Search for particular rows and columns 
3. Calcualte aggregate statistics
4. Combine data from multiple sources 

Pandas introduces a new data type which is called DataFrame,
which represents tabular data.

How to use pandas:- 
1. Load the data in the dataframe. 
One of the easiest way to create DataFrame is by using a CSV file.
CSV - Comma Separated Values, and is a common way of storing tabular data as a
text - only file.
YOu can Download a CSV vesion of data from an excel spreadsheet, SQL database,
or a Google Sheet.

Import Pandas:-
import pandas as pd 

Turning CSV to dataframe:-
df = pd.read_csv('ransom.csv')

df.head() - This just selects the first 5 rows
in order to see that we need to put df.head() inside the print function

Another way of learning more about the db is:- 
Inspecting the DataFrame
df.info() - We put this inside the print statement
IN this we can see the names of the columns, number of rowsm and data
type of each column.
This method os useful for csv having many columns where using head would be
hard.
