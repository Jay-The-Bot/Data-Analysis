Missing values

We can check whether there is some missing value in a dataframe 
by -> dogs.isna() -> This will give True/False output for the missing values.

If we do dogs.isna().any() -> we one value for each column whether missing values are present
in that column or not.

dogs.isna().sum() -> will give the sum of total Nan values in a column and gives a column wise total.

We can also visualize it by plotting it dogs.isna().sum().plot(kind='bar')

To remove the rows that contain missing value ->
dogs.dropna()

replace missing value with another value ->
dogs.fillna(0) -> will fill the missing values with 0
