Pandas is a python package for data manipulation. It can also be used for data visualization. 

Pandas is built on 2 essential python packages, numpy and Matplotlib.

Numpy:- Provides easy data manipulation, pandas use it to store the data.
Matplotlib:- Powerful data visualization capabilities

DataFrames:- 
head() -> Shows the first 5 rows of the dataset.
info() -> Displays the name's of columns and the datatype they contain, and whether they have any missing values.
shape -> It tuples out the no. of rows, and the no. of columns. Since this is an attribute instead of method, we write it without parentheses.
describe() -> Computes some numerical statistics for the numerical columns.
	count -> The number of non missing values in each column.

A dataframe has 3 attributes accessible using attributes, the values attribute contains the data attribute in a 2-D Numpy array. The other 2 components of a dataframe are columns and rows. The column attribute contains the column name and the index attribute contains the row numbers or row names.

index

Change the order of the row by sorting them .sort_values("column_name")
We can also do it in the opposite order .sort_values("column_name", ascending=False).

We can also multiple variables using a list of values by passing a list of column _names such as .sort_values(["column_1", "column_2"])
This will first sort the column_1 then the column_2.
To change the direction the values are sorted in,
.sort_values(["column_1", "column_2"], ascending=[True, False]).

To view multiple selected columns we need 2 pairs of square brackets.
dogs[["column_1", "column_2"]].
THe outer brackets are responsible for sub setting the data frame. Inner Square brackets are creating a list of column names to subset.
