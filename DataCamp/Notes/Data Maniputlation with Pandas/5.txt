YOu can also sort the dataframe but first we 
need to sort the index.
dogs.set_index(['breed', 'color']).sort_index()

To slice rows at the outer level of a index you call loc, passing
the first and last values separated by a colon.
Technique -> dogs_srt.loc["Chow Chow": "Poodle"]
Differences:-
1. Specify row values rather than row indexes.
2. Final value is included.

The same technique does not work for the inner index level.

The correct approach of slicing at inner index levels is to pass the
first and last positions as tuples.

dogs_srt.loc[("Labrador", "Brown") : ("Schnauzer", "Grey")]

Slicing Columns ->
dogs_srt.loc[:, "name": "height_cm"]

Slice twice ->
dogs_srt.loc[("Labrador", "Brown") : ("Schnauzer", "Grey"), "name":"height_cm"]

We slice the dates with the same syntax as the other types. The first and last date are
passed as strings.

dogs.loc["2014-08-25":"2016-09-16"] -> Slicing by dates

You can also slice by partial dates.
dogs.loc["2014":"2016"] -> pandas interpret this as slicing from the start of
2014 to the end of 2016

Slice by row/column number ->
dogs.iloc[2:5, 1:4] -> 2 arguments first one for row and the second one for the column.
Unlike loc the final values are not included in the slice.
