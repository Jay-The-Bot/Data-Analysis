A dictionary is a way of storing the data in a dataframe.

We can create a dictionary by using ->
my_dict = {
    "key_1" : value1,
    "key_2" : value2,
    "key_3" : value3
}

We can access the value in the dictionary using the keys ->
e.g -> my_dict['key_1'] --> value1.

We can create dataframe using the 2 imp methods
1. From a list of dictionaries -> In this method we add the data to the dictionary row by row.
2. From dictionary of list -> In this method we add the data column by column.

We can convert a dictionary to a frame using ->
pd.DataFrame(my_dict) -> This wil give the o/p as a dataframe
