Quantitative comparison of scatter plot: 
Bar charts shows us the values of ine variable across different conditions, 
such as different countries.
Bi-variate comparisons -> Compare the values of different variables across observations.
This involves the values of 2 different variables.
A standard visualization of bi-variate comparison is a scatter plot.
ax.scatter(climate_change['co2'], climate_change['relative_temp'])
The first argument will correspond to the distance to the height of x-axis,
the second argument will correspond to the height along the y-axis.

We can customize scatter plots in a manner that is similar to the customization
that we use in other plots.
E.g. -> eighties = climate_change['1980-01-01':'1989-12-31']
We can also use the color of the points to encode a third variable,
providing additional information about the comparison.

ax.scatter(climate_change['co2'], climate_change['relative_temp'], c=climate_change.index)

If we enter the index as input to the c-keyword, this variable will get encoded as color.
