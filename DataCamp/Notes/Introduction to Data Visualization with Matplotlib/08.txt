Quantitative Comparisons: Histograms
This visualization is useful because it shows us the entire distribution
of values within a variable.

x-axis is the values in the variable and the height of the bar
represents the number of observations within a particular bin of values.

Labels are important in a histogram as we cant tell which part of data is which one.
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Rowing', bins=5)
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Gymnastics', bins=5)

default bins = 10

If we provide a set of values to bins that will be set as the bounderies between bins ->
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Rowing', bins=[150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210])
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Gymnastics', bins=[150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210])

The bars if the gymnastics histogram are occluding this information. THe occlusion can be
eliminated by changing the type of histogram that is used.
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Rowing', bins=[150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210], histtype='step')
ax.hist(mens_rowing['Height'], label='Gymnastics', bins=[150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210], histtype='step')
Step -> Displays histogram as thin lines instead of solid bar.
