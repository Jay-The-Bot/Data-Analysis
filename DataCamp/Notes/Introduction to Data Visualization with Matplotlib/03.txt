In matplotlib small multiples are called subplots.
They are used when there is too much data in a plot.

Small multiples are typically arranged on the page as a grid with rows and columns.
fig, ax = plt.subplot(3, 2)
This will create a plots for 3 rows, and 2 columns.
Before adding any data we will get a total of 6 diagrams.
ax.shape -> (3, 2) -> array of axis object with a shape of 3, 2.

To add data we would have to index in this object and call the plot
method on an element of an array. 
ax[0, 0].plot(seattle_weather["Months"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"], color='b')

There would be some cases for situations where you have only one row and only one column of plots.
In this case the resulting array will be one dimensional and you will only have to provide one index
to access the elements of the array.
E.g. -> fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

We can use .set_xlabel and .set_ylabel or any other function on all the plots.

If we know that the plots will be on top of each other then we only add the .set_xlabel
to the bottom plot.

To make sure all the subplots have the same range if y-axis values, we 
initialize the figure and its subplots with the key-word argument sharey to true.
E.g. -> fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharey=True)
This means both subplots will have the same range if y-axis values, based on the data
from both datasets.
