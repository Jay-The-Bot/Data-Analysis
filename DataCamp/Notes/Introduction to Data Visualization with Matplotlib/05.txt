Plotting Time Series with different variables ->
We use the method twinx to create a twin of axes. -> 
This means two axes share the same x-axes, but the y-axes are separate, but the
y -axes are separate.
ax2 = ax.twinx()
We add the other variable to the second axes object and show the figure.

This will create a y-axis on each side of the plot one for the C02, and the other
for the temperature variable.

ax.tick_params('y', color='blue) -> This method takes either 'y' or 'x' as its
first argument, pointing to the fact we are modifying the parameters of the y-axis ticks
and tick labels.

Ticks -> The numbers on each of the axes.

define the above as a function ->
def plot_timeseries(axes, x, y, color, xlabel, ylabel):
    axes.plot(x, y)
    axes.set_xlabel(xlabel)
    axes.set_ylabel(ylabel)
    axes.tick_params('y', colors=color)
