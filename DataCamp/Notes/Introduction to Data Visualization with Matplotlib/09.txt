Statistical Plotting:
Statistical Plotting is a set of method for visualizing to make comparisons.

ax.bar("", mens_rowing['Height'].mean(), yerr=mens_rowing['Height'].std())
ax.bar("", mens_['Height'].mean(), yerr=mens_gymnastics['Height'].std())
.std() -> standard deviation of the column.
There are atleast 2 ways to add a error bar, above we added the error bar as an argument to the bar chart.

Adding error bars to a line plot ->
ax.errorbar(seattle_weather['MONTH'], seattle_weather['MLY-TAVG-NORMAL'], yerr=seattle_weather['MLY-TAVG-STDDEV'])
ax.errorbar(austin_weather['MONTH'], austin_weather['MLY-TAVG-NORMAL'], yerr=austin_weather['MLY-TAVG-STDDEV'])

Like the plot method this method takes a sequence of x values, in this case 'MONTH' column.
And a sequence of y values, in this case the column with normal average monthly temperature.
yerr can take a column of the data that contains the std() deviation of the average monthly temperatures.
Similar to before this adds verticals markers to the plot.

The second way is the box plot.
It is implemented as the method of the axes object. We can call it sequences of the sequences.
ax.boxplot([mens_rowing['Height'], mens_gymnastics['Height']]) -> and pass this list to the method.
Boxplot doesnt know the variables on each column we add that separately.
ax.set_xticklabels(['Rowing', 'Gymnastics'])
ax.set_yticklabel('Height (cm)')

This kind of plot shows us several landmarks in each distribution.
The red line indicates the median height. The edges of the box portion at the center,
indicate the inter-quartile range of the data, between the 25% and the 75% percentiles.
The whiskers at the end if the thin bars indicate one and half times the size of the inter-quartile
range beyond the 75th and the 25th percentiles.
This should encompass 99% of the distribution if the data is Gaussian or normal.
Points that appear beyond the whiskers are outliers. That means they have values larger or smaller
than you would expect for 99percent of the data in a Gaussian or normal distribution.
