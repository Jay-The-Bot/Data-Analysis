Saving a figure to file ->
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(medals.index, medals['Gold'])
ax.set_xtickslabels(medals.index, rotation=90)
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Medals")
// To save a file we use fig.savefig()
fig.savefig('gold_medals.png') -> THis will save the figure with a name of gold_medals.png

PNG format -> Provides lossless compression of your image. High quality, high space.

We can also use jgp format 
JPG format -> Uses lossy compression that can be used to create figures that take up less space
and less bandwidth.

We can also change the quality of the image by setting the quality ->
fig.savefig('gold_medals.jpg', quality=50)

We should avoid value above 95 because at that point compression is no longer effective.

fig.savefig('gold_medals.svg') ->
Choosing a svg format will create a vector graphics file where different elements can be
edited in detail by advanced software such as gimp, Adobe Illustrator.

Another keyword to control the quality of the images is the dpi argument ->
DPI -> Dots per Inch
fig.savefig('gold_medals.png', dpi=300) -> The higher the densely the image will rendered.

To control the size of the images we can use ->
fig.set_size_inches([5,3]) -> This function takes a sequence of numbers first number takes the 
width of the figure and the second number takes the height of the figure.

So setting the size would also determine the aspect ratio of the figure.
