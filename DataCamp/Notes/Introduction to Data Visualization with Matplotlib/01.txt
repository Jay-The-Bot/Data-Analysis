Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib ->
Matplotlib allows for us to completely control of the plot.

Their are many ways to use matplotlib -> Object orientated way (is used here)
The plt.subplots() command creates 2 different objects: 
1. fig -> Figure -> The figure is a container that holds everything you that you see on a page.
2. ax -> Axes -> The part of the page that holds thee data.
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

It is the canvas on which we draw on which we will draw our data and visualize it.

The plotting commands are the methods of the axes object.   
E.g. -> ax.plot(seattle_weather['month'], seattle_weather['mly-tagv-normal'])
